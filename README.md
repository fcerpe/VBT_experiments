# VBT_experiments
Repository to store all the experiments made in PsychoPy for the Visual Braille Training project.

All projects were administered to participants via Pavlovia (https://pavlovia.org). The actual experiments can be found in GitLab (the platform used by Pavlovia)
In this repository, we are hosting a copy of those files for data-sharing purposes, as well as the links to the actual experiments.

## Legend of names

Experiment names are not explicit in telling what is being tested, for two reasons: to not spoil the experiment, and because we ran previous pilots on multiple durations of the test words.
For this reason, all experiments follow the same structured name: vbt_bX_dayY
- vbt simply stands for Visual Braille Training, the name of the experiment
- b stands for the variant of the test duration: b1 is Braille, b2 is Line Braille
- day indicates the sessions
